# farm
I created this project during my undergrad CS program. Submitted as a final year project.

Bsc. Computer Science Final Year(2019-2020).

Hello!

The project was created using php, javascript, mysql. Xampp was used to host this project . Why xampp? XAMPP is an abbreviation for cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl, and it allows you to build site offline, on a local web server on your computer.

Description:

    The project was created with an intention that if a farmer wants to sell their farm produce like fruits, vegetables , seeds or diary products like milk, etc or if they want, they can sell them online using this website, also provide information like nutritious value and stuff related to the products easily using this website.
    The customer just have to register and login themselves and can buy any product easily, online. They can view the blogs , gain information and buy products if they want. 
    
Components:

1.Index file.(Home page)
2.Login/Register
3.Product and service Categories like (vegetables, Milk, Fruits, Seeds, and additional option of rooms available.). 
4.The admin(Farmer) can describe the product , put up images about the product, quanity,etc.
5.Dashboard: To view total sales,sales for current day, number of products, number of users. The admin can add new users, categories and product.
6.View Cart for customers
7.Check-out online.



To run the project:
1. Install xampp/wampp , but for this project I used xampp and for xampp, after installation start xampp-control panel and start 2 buttons apache and mysql.
2. Go to phpmyadmin(or click on the admin section in front of apache of xampp control panel ) and open phpmyadmin page .
3. When phpmyadmin server page is opened, click on new tab, write the database name(if you have a sql file(farm.sql like this format) write that name eg. farm)and select create button.
4. After that import the sql file / create the desired tables.
5. Make project/ unzip the project/ copy paste the whole project inside the xampp>htdocs folder and paste your folder e.g for me , my location was C:\xampp\htdocs\farm 
6. To run project make sure the folder path is correct ,your xampp-control panel is open and both the actions in front of Apache and mysql and started. IF working properly green colour will be highlighted in both of their names.
7. After everything is done. Write eg. localhost/farm or whatever your filename is and run the file in the browser.(any browser).
8. If any error occurs .. Very common.. Mysql error. Now this might occur if you have password set for mysql and while creating project you have not passed the correct mysql password, or sometimes because of mysql's presence your xampp might not work, so check thoroughly (errors) and copy paste them and google properly.

P.S i did this project earlier and used the older version of xampp, so version difference error might occur.
